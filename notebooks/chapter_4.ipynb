Alejandro Reynoso, Chief Scientist DEFI CAPITAL RESEARCH\n","\n","    This document defines the minimum standard for Level 4 innovation assets\n","    in accounting and audit contexts.\n","\n","    CONTROLLED CHANGE MANAGEMENT\n","    ----------------------------\n","    - All playbooks, test harnesses, and QA artifacts must be versioned\n","    - Changes require approval from designated SME and methodology owner\n","    - Release notes must document: purpose, scope, breaking changes, rollback procedure\n","    - Version control system (Git or equivalent) required for all playbook code\n","    - Change log must track: who, what, when, why for every modification\n","\n","    EVALUATION HARNESS REQUIREMENTS\n","    --------------------------------\n","    - Every playbook must have minimum test coverage:\n","      * 2+ golden test cases (expected happy path)\n","      * 3+ adversarial test cases (prompt injection, hallucination, missing data)\n","      * 2+ regression test cases (past failure patterns)\n","    - Acceptance criteria must be concrete and measurable (not \"reasonable\" or \"adequate\")\n","    - Evaluation results must be logged with run ID and timestamp\n","    - Failed evaluations must trigger investigation before deployment\n","\n","    ADVERSARIAL QA DISCIPLINE\n","    -------------------------\n","    - Adversarial testing is MANDATORY, not optional\n","    - Test for: prompt injection, hallucination, confidentiality leakage, invented authority\n","    - Red team review required for high-risk playbooks (tax, audit evidence, client-facing)\n","    - Adversarial test cases must be updated when new attack patterns discovered\n","\n","    AUDIT TRAIL ARTIFACTS + RETENTION\n","    ----------------------------------\n","    - Every run must produce:\n","      * run_manifest.json (run ID, config, environment fingerprint)\n","      * prompts_log.jsonl (all prompts and responses with redaction and hashes)\n","      * risk_log.json (risk register entries)\n","      * deliverables/ (all generated artifacts)\n","      * evaluation_summary (test results and scoring)\n","    - Retention: minimum 7 years for audit/SOX contexts; follow firm document retention policy\n","    - Artifacts must be tamper-evident (hashes, timestamps, read-only storage)\n","\n","    MONITORING + ROLLBACK TRIGGERS\n","    -------------------------------\n","    - Define monitoring metrics for deployed playbooks:\n","      * Hallucination detection rate\n","      * User intervention rate (human override frequency)\n","      * Error/exception frequency\n","      * Evaluation score trends\n","    - Rollback triggers (automatic revert to prior version if):\n","      * Hallucination rate exceeds threshold (e.g., >5% of outputs)\n","      * Evaluation score drops below acceptance criteria\n","      * Critical risk identified (confidentiality leak, invented authority)\n","      * User complaints exceed threshold\n","\n","    INCIDENT RESPONSE\n","    -----------------\n","    - Hallucination event: document what was generated, root cause, corrective action\n","    - Confidentiality leak event: immediate escalation, containment, notification per policy\n","    - Postmortem required for all high-severity incidents (template provided)\n","    - Lessons learned incorporated into adversarial test suite\n","\n","    TRAINING + CERTIFICATION\n","    ------------------------\n","    - Only certified individuals may approve playbook changes\n","    - Certification requires:\n","      * Completion of evaluation discipline training\n","      * Demonstrated hands-on adversarial QA experience\n","      * Pass governance and risk management assessment\n","    - Annual recertification required\n","\n","    DISCLAIMER\n","    ----------\n","
